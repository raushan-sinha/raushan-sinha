                            I began my coding journey inspired by a friend. Initially unaware of this path, I soon realized how much I loved logic and problem-solving. That curiosity marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life.

                            I enrolled in BCA at Maharaja College, VKSU. My education gave me a strong foundation in programming, especially in C++, Java, and the basics of software development.

                            I built projects like login forms, portfolios, calculators, and a Ludo game using HTML & CSS. I also practiced DSA, improved my problem-solving skills, and deployed projects on Vercel and Netlify.
