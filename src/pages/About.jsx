                            I began my coding journey inspired by a friend. Initially unaware of this path, I soon realized how much I loved logic and problem-solving. That curiosity marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life.

                            I enrolled in BCA at Maharaja College, VKSU. My education gave me a strong foundation in programming, especially in C++, Java, and the basics of software development.

                            I built projects like login forms, portfolios, calculators, and a Ludo game using HTML & CSS. I also practiced DSA, improved my problem-solving skills, and deployed projects on Vercel and Netlify.

                        Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Raushan Sinha</strong> ‚Äî a passionate Frontend Developer üë®‚Äçüíª who builds responsive and interactive websites.
                        I use {techStacks.map((name, idx) => (
                            <strong key={idx}>{name}</strong>
                        ))}.
                        Some of my best works include <em>VirtuoX</em>, <em>Sendify</em>, and <em>TechStorm</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I‚Äôm currently learning backend technologies like MySQL, and planning to add <strong>Next.js, Node.js</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong> to my stack.
                        I post blogs on Dev Community and Daily.dev, and share projects on GitHub, LinkedIn, and X to showcase my work and connect with potential employers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of coding, I love exploring new tech, writing, and learning continuously. My dream is to build full-scale web apps that make users' lives better, cleaner, and more engaging.
